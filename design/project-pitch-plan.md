Learning an instrument like guitar is meant to be a fun hobby! Unfortunately, many beginners get discouraged. With so many chords, it can be hard to determine where to start. Often, new guitarists feel like it will be too long before they can play any songs, causing many to give up entirely. In fact, 90% of new guitarists abandon the instrument within a year, according to Fender.

And that’s exactly where Chord Connect steps in. Instead of leaving beginners overwhelmed, we give them a clear path forward. Chord Connect helps new guitarists play real music sooner in their journey by matching them with songs that fit the chords they already know. It also gives them a space to learn alongside others, stay motivated, and actually enjoy the process.

With Chord Connect, beginners don’t have to guess what to learn next. They get direction, support, and a community that grows with them.

Now let’s take a look at how it works.

1:20-2:30 - Walkthrough features (Yahir + Kali)
ChordConnect will offer a handful of features to help beginners stick with their guitar-learning journey!

- ChordConnect will allow users to maintain an inventory of their known chords. With this, the user would be provided a list of songs they can already play given the chords they know. This would allow users to start playing songs even with a limited set of known chords, hopefully keeping them engaged early on. 
- Given this log, an AI-augmented tool would recommend the next best chord to learn. Alongside these recommendations, the feature would show the user what songs they would “unlock” learning the next chord. This is also designed to keep users motivated and encourage continued process.
- Beyond specific chords, our app would allow users to keep a journal of songs. This would let them mark various songs as “in progress”, “proficient”, and “mastered”. As they improve, they can choose to post these updates to their feed. On the feed, users can see their friends learning updates and comment words of encouragement or leave a positive reaction such as “like”, “love”, and “celebrate”. This feature would allow users to share in their journey with friends, hopefully keeping them motivated and allowing them to source advice from others.
- We would encourage learners to use music socially. When friends get together, they could start a jam session on the app which would show them which songs they all know or have the ability to learn given the chords they know. Sharing in your hobbies is a valuable way to stay motivated, and we hope that this feature would help users achieve this.
- Finally, if users are seeking to join or create a jam group, our app connects them with local users holding the same music skills and interests. 
However, some people may not have any friends they could jam with. For these users, they can seek out a group of other musicians using the app. This would present them with local users at a similar skill level who are also seeking a group.
