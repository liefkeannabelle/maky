# User Testing Overview
We created the [task list](task-list.md), including the tasks we asked each user to perform, our reasoning, and the places where we would or would not provide support.

We then conducted each of our two user tests, documented as [session 1](session1.md) and [session 2](session2.md).

From there, we identified the key [takeaways](takeaways.md), including current strengths, pain points, and places for improvement.
