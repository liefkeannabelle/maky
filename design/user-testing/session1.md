# User Testing Session 1: NAME
## Prep
Overview:
- You will be given a list of tasks to perform in order on the ChordConnect app, each with corresponding instructions.
- As you perform each task, please think aloud and communicate any observations, thoughts, or points of confusion.
- There are certain points at which I can answer questions, and others where I cannot. Regardless, I encourage you to vocalize all questions. 
- I will intervene if you are stuck such that you can no longer progress through the task list. 
- I will be taking notes as you work through the process and we will debrief more specific thoughts after you are done.

## Task Notes
Provide the tester with the [task list](task-list.md). Take notes corresponding to each step. 

## Debrief
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- What did you find confusing? 
- Was there anything you were hoping to do/imagining doing?
