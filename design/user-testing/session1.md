# User Testing Session 1: Sean
## Prep
Overview:
- You will be given a list of tasks to perform in order on the ChordConnect app, each with corresponding instructions.
- As you perform each task, please think aloud and communicate any observations, thoughts, or points of confusion.
- There are certain points at which I can answer questions, and others where I cannot. Regardless, I encourage you to vocalize all questions. 
- I will intervene if you are stuck such that you can no longer progress through the task list. 
- I will be taking notes as you work through the process and we will debrief more specific thoughts after you are done.

## Task Notes
Provide the tester with the [task list](task-list.md). Take notes corresponding to each step. 
|#|Task Name | Notes                            |
|-|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|  
|1|Register Account | Asked about being a private account, assumed |
|2|Login | Autofilled from google, worked smoothly   |
|3|Set Up Profile | Liked color palette, hard to see color difference with brightness level|
|4|Explore Chords + Songs | Hard to tell that songs are loading, unclear that chord explorer and song explorer are seperate, wanted to be able to add as target song from that page.                             |
|5|Set Target Song | Added easily                              |
|6|Learn Recommended Chords |                     |
|7|Start Learning Song |       |
|8|Continue Learning | Wants to be able to see tabs (linked maybe), can't remove songs from song bank, didn't click update when changing mastery (used to autosave), want to be able to clear things, have search and filtering for "practice songs" section                            |
|9|Capture Your Progress | Search chords isn't working, pressing enter posts            |
|10|Make Update Public |  Would still like to be able to see them once posted                              |
|11|Connect with Friends | First started typing in the "search friends" box, would like to be able to see outgoing pending requests      |
|12|Interact with Feed | Took a second to realize could comment     |
|13|Create a Jam Group| Went very smoothly             |
|14|Start a Jam Session | Did it without prompting       |
|15|Explore Jam Session | Liked the feature, some uncertainty as the           |
|16|Private Account | Thought it would be in profile page, wished there was description in the beginning                 | 

## Debrief
*What worked well?*
- Liked the social aspect overall
- Thought most of the workflow was fairly intuitive
*What could be improved?*
- Confusion could be avoided with more info about the purpose/functionality of varoius features (ie. private accounts, song+chord explorer, etc).
*What did you find confusing?*
- Shared incremental confusions but overall found it pretty smooth, unclear whether it is a learning tool or a coordinating tool (should make more clear + integrating the actual learning tools)
- Not sure the jam session serves a useful purpose, maybe be able to do things retroactively, makes more sense after explaining (could make it more clear to see what the thought process is)
*Was there anything you were hoping to do/imagining doing?*
Would like to be able to log playing together even without having done a jam session (maybe attach users to feed posts)
