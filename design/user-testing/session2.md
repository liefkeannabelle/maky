# User Testing Session 2: Nathra
## Prep
Overview:
- You will be given a list of tasks to perform in order on the ChordConnect app, each with corresponding instructions.
- As you perform each task, please think aloud and communicate any observations, thoughts, or points of confusion.
- There are certain points at which I can answer questions, and others where I cannot. Regardless, I encourage you to vocalize all questions. 
- I will intervene if you are stuck such that you can no longer progress through the task list. 
- I will be taking notes as you work through the process and we will debrief more specific thoughts after you are done.

# Task List
|#|Task Name | Instruction         | Notes                                |
|-|----------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|  
|1|Register Account | Select a unique username, email, and password to create a new account      | would like to see password just typed in when registering and logging in.                                 |
|2|Login | With your newly created account, login |                 |
|3|Set Up Profile | Update the various fields of the user profile as desired    | can’t recognize the songs in target songs. |
|4|Explore Chords + Songs | On the discover page, explore song bank for a target song        | visualized one chord (Em7). is Em7 four notes? Is that accurate? Looked for finger diagram of em7 there’s quite a few variants on the website. Am7 looks accurate. Trying to see from which perspective is the diagram. May need to give some PSAs for beginners on how to interpret diagram. Like a little “i”.                    |
|5|Set Target Song | On the profile page, add the identified target song        |                                 |Bug in target song. Shows up as chrd-1340.          
|6|Learn Recommended Chords | On the learn page, start learning the first three recommended chords         |                                 |
|7|Start Learning Song | Find a song that piques your interest and start learning it        | Thinks it’s really cool that they can see songs they can practice. “Sound would be really helpful”. Even for chord to be able to hear it.                               |
|8|Continue Learning | Explore the features of the learn page, adding and udpating chords and songs        | "All chords mastered" was not a filtering feature they saw immediately. Liked the difference in color based on status. Red on red seems like a brave choice but she likes maroon so she’s not mad about it.                               |
|9|Capture Your Progress | Add a journal entry to reflect recent progress        | confused if the posts on the journal page would be public or private. Should probably show that it’s private or say it in text somewhere on the page.                |
|10|Make Update Public | After posting, make the most recent journal entry public       | Doesn’t know where the post disappeared. Isn’t clear to them that the journal is only private. Does like the physical separation but “I wish I could still see it somewhere, I did panic when it went away”                               |
|11|Connect with Friends | On the feed page, add barbara and madalina as friends        |         |
|12|Interact with Feed | With friends added, react and comment to their feed posts      |  Scrolls through posts and comments easily. Wants to click on their profile but can’t see profiles.     |
|13|Create a Jam Group| On the jam page, create a new jam group and add your recently added friends       | Likes that genres are included in the playable songs.               |
|14|Start a Jam Session | With your newly formed group, start a jam session       |         |
|15|Explore Jam Session | After starting a jam session, explore the jam session page        | Practice this song doesn’t go anywhere . “Oh, I get it! 5 Chords everyone knows, now I practice with barbara”. Observed that you can have a record of who joined and who didn’t, and the history of songs you practiced.            |
|16|Private Account | Finally, on the account settings page, change your account to private       | “Account” should be changed to settings - recommendation from Nathra. “Did making it private move the post back to journal page?”. Tried to make the kid account not a kid account. Asked if this the difference between kid and private account.                |





## Debrief
- *What worked well?*
 Genre description nice addition. Can we search by genre? 
Liked that you can tag songs on posts. Liked the journal because it’s a way to keep yourself accountable. (Madalina’s note: can you see date on journal posts?). Jam session history is good. 
- *What could be improved?*
My post should switch over when turning the private account. Want to be able to hear the chords. Wonders if we can show chord progressions (like order of chords). 
- *What did you find confusing?* 
If on the jam page was a description of what a jam is/is supposed to use. Can get the idea of the jam like in spotify, but didn’t get the point at first, only made sense after I explained it (Madalina’s note: perhaps an FAQ?)
- *Was there anything you were hoping to do/imagining doing?*
A short tutorial on at least one song to see how to get started. Would like to upload videos of the songs to be able to go back and see it. 
Being able to upload songs (since database is limited), so I can still track my progress and stuff even if it’s not on the website.
