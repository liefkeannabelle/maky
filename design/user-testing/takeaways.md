# User Testing Takeaways
## Session 1 
### Report
In the user testing session, navigation went smoothly and the user voiced positive thoughts throughout the process, particularly about the organization of the app and the chosen color scheme. In many cases, the user vocalized their percieved next step in-line with the intended next step, enforcing the idea that the overall user journey is fairly intuitive.

The main confusion stemmed from poor communication of goals within the app itself. As developers, we are very familiar with the imagined user journey and desired impact of each feature. However, because we all understand this desired behavior, we have not documented it as well in the app itself. In particular, Sean mentioned wanting more clarity regarding:
- The purpose of the app (supporting learning rather than learning itself)
- Where to find supporting resources (i.e. tabs)
- Private accounts on registration page
- Purpose of chord and song explorers
  - Chord info alongside chord explorer
- Use case for jam groups + sessions

### Flaws & Improvements
In addition to these points of clarity, Sean pointed out a handful of suggested improvements, some very straightforward and some a bit more complex:
#### Improvements 
*Easy Additions*
- Make user's public posts also visible on the journal page
- Make song the target song from discover page
- Be able to search/sort own song bank like you can the playable song list
- Current color scheme (particularly background) requires high-brightness to be able to see necessary contrast

*More Complex Additions*
- Be able to retroactively log jam sessions
  - The ability to attach a jam session to a post
- Prompt to journal/post learning updates as you mark them on the learn page
#### Flaws 
- Can't attach a chord to a post
- Jam sessions are showing as started by an ID, rather than a user

## Session 2 
### Report
Throughout the user testing session, there were no major impediments in running and effectively using the app. Overall, the user was satisfied with the functionality the app offers and saw its ability to serve as a driving force in learning to play guitar. As an overall comment for improvement, ChordConnect could use more explanations at times about the vision of our app, as a *guiding* tool for learning rather than a learning tool in and of itself. 

### Flaws & Improvements
#### Improvements
*Easy Additions*
- Toggle to see password under login/register
- Add a "How To"/information button for reading diagrams, concept of jam groups.
- Renaming/Merging/Moving things around in user profile & user account
- Be more descriptive what journal is meant to be (to understand the privacy aspect)
- Add date on journal 7 feed's posts

*More Complex Additions*
- Change posts back to private when the account becomes kid/private
- Tutorial on interpreting the app or like how to go about chords & learning songs & reading finger diagrams.
- Adding video upload functionality in posts
- Audio for the songs (has now been implemented)
- Audio for how chords sound

#### Flaws
- Bug after setting target song. Shows up as "chrd-1340".
