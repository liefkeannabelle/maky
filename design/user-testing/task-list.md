# Task List
Formulate a task list. To make sure your user tests yield informative results, it can often be better to set your users specific tasks rather than let them explore your app in an open-ended way.

Create a list of tasks that cover the key concepts of your app, focusing on the concepts that are particularly unique or important to your design. Each task should typically involve executing a sequence of user interaction actions. You should include at least 5 tasks, from simple one-action tasks to more complex multi-action tasks, that will test how easily the user can cross the gulfs of execution and evaluation discussed in lecture. You should plan for these tasks to take roughly 40 minutes of your hour session.

Format your task list as a table, where each row corresponds to a different task and with columns for: (1) a short title for each task; (2) a succinct instruction, in words that could be given to the user; and, (3) a brief rationale for including the task, explaining why the task is worth testing, what you hope to learn or uncover about your design when testing this task with a user versus excuting it yourself as part of a cognitive walkthrough. Order the rows in such a way that any application state required by subsequent tasks has been correctly setup by earlier tasks.
