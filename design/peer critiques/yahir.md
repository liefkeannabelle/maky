# Yahir's Peer Critique
## What are some aspects of the project that you like, and why?
I really like the focus on the iterative recipe development and treating recipes as something one is able to revisit and evolve rather than having forever static instructions. The snapshot idea feels like a natural and easy way of doing that!

I also think the design of the app is super cute and elegant, I thought the UI sketches were very well-made and it follows a very journal-esque kind of design which I think would be pretty effective for me! 

## What are some aspects of the project that you wish were different in some way?
Specific to the project pitch, I do wish I was sold a bit more on the evidence behind the problem since it was a key component of the pitch. The quotes from the cookbook authors were great, but it would have also been cool to see some statistical evidence or numbers (e.g., percentage of home cooks struggling) if possible. I think it would help make the problem feel more widespread and urgent, framing it as a "common problem" rather than a "relatable issue". 

I think a quick snapshot feature would be nice where users can easily take a photo, add some details, and then update it later (expanded on in next prompt).

## What are some aspects you are wondering about; perhaps some suggestions for a simplification, a different approach, or whatever?
I am very curious as to how the app will feel in practice, like will people realistically fill out all the fields every time they cook, or would there be a "quick snapshot" feature and then lets them add features/details later. The recipes + snapshot feels super effective and strong, so I really wonder how the recipes and snapshots will be modeled in the backend, and I liked seeing how you designed your concepts/syncs which definitely helps me reconsider how I designed mine. Also, I was definitely wondering about the different types of apps that are already exist which was nice to see in your Problem Framing.
