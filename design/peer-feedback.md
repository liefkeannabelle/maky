## In-Class Pitch Questions
### Clarifications
#### General
- Do you see there being two sides of the platform for uses to do “solo” interaction or “jam” session?
- What will be the user journey for the app. You mentioned it is designed for starter, then how will users end stage of using this app?
- It’s this designed just for beginners or can it helpful to people of all levels? Can an intermediate player indicate where they’re at when they start to skip learning the stuff they already know?
- How does this app make learning easier?

#### Learning
- How are you thinking of using AI to help with recommending chords since the connection between different chords seems a bit arbitrary?
- Are you using LLMs to recommend what chords to learn next or how is that determined?
- How are you decide what chords you're going to teach?
- How will you get tabs?
- When tracking the songs you can play/are learning to play, can you save the tabs for the song and/or a video?
- Will you include lessons/some more specific way of learning the chords besides suggesting the next best chord to learn?
- Will this app be used for education like teaching chords?
- Would you playing the guitar get recorded and analyzed by your app or is the user manually inputting the chords played?
- Will the app include the opportunity to learn new songs?
- How are you creating the lesson plans? Is this all AI generated? Or its structured pre lessons hard coded?
- Will the app teach users new chords?
- Does your app also teach its users or is it a recommender? 
- Who decides whether a user has "mastered" a song? Is there some test in the app or will it be based on what the user is feeling / classifies their progress? 
- Will users be able to ask questions, for example, about correct technique or finger placement? Without feedback or help with a blocking issue it can be difficult for beginners to progress.
- How will the user determine they are ready to move on to a new chord?
- Is there content on ChordConnect for beginners to be able to learn notes and strings before chords?
- As someone who self-learned guitar for a little bit, I think this is a cool idea! Although, I think that suggesting songs solely on what chords the user knows may not be quite enough. Do you have any plans to consider other things like the user's song taste preferences or something?
- Are these chords that the user has to know by heart? I think a lot of beginner guitarist kind of know chords and just need the diagram to brush up. Suggesting songs by difficulty instead of exact chords they know could be better.
- Is there a way for a user to know if they played a chord well?
- Love the video. Do users start from the same set of chords to begin with or do they pick a set of songs? It could be cool to allow users to learn chords to a song that they want to know. I could see that being potentially more motivating initially. Overall great concept too.
- A lot of songs have multiple possibilities for chord progressions. Would the app present the user with different options for each song (based on expertise level or something) or is there only one specific progression it will present for a given song?
- Do you plan on having different levels for each guitar?  And how do you decide the skill level of the guitarist?  Each song can have less or more complex sets of chords and rythms (right?), so how do you decide if the user is proficient, mastered, or in progress.

#### Social
- Is feed opt-in or opt-out? I personally wouldn't want other people how I struggle during learning an instrument....
- Are jam sessions virtual or in person?
- How will you determine that different people have similar skills?
- How will jam groups work? Will the group just get a list of songs they all know and vote on which one to play together or will there be an option for them to have more freedom to pick songs?
- Can all users see your posts or is limited to "friends" or "followers"?
- Can you also post full songs?
- Will there be a public feed where users can see posts from unknown users or is it going to be a purely friends feed?
- How can users join a jam session? Do you need to both be "friends" through the social media feed or is it through specific invites?

### Concerns
#### General
- How do you differentiate your app from existing more popular apps like Simply Guitar?
- How is this different from comparables, like an instructor/ a tutoring app/ notes?
- How is ChordConnect different than guitar/instrument planning apps that already exist? 
- How do you differentiate yourself from other apps that teach guitar chords? I feel like there are many apps with similar function.
- What compels users to use this as opposed to just watching lessons on Youtube? How do you know things aren't being hallucinated?
- Do a lot of the team members play guitar? Do you generally represent the target demographic (people who give up guitar due to frustration), and if so, how are your experienced pain points affecting your app's direction? 
- How would this app stay up to date with new music and the chords associated with those new songs?
- Do you think it could be confusing for the app to have two seemingly different purposes: learning chords, sharing music?
- What would you say is the main purpose of the app? I really like the features proposed, but I feel like there's a lot going on, especially with the 3(?) different social media features proposed.
- This seems like a lot of features, what's the scheduling of the project looking like?
- Would you be able to use this app without a guitar? Would you want to add features so that users who are unsure of whether or not they want to buy a guitar can use the app

#### Learning 
- How does the song suggestion aspect differ from what is already offered? many music teaching websites have the functionality
- Is there a way to "unlearn" chords? Say you leave for a while and then come back but you forgot how to play a certain chord. What would happen then?
- Where will the music come from getting the music from. It can be difficult to source quality sheet mesic and even open source things liek ultimate guitar often have poor and inaccurate tabs. 
- I don't see the use of the AI feature here, because when I learned guitar, I think there is a fix set of basic chords you need to learn, and it's not too complex, but it's important to know them all first. You can basically google fundamental guitar chords, and there will be a bunch of recommendations. So how is AI gonna help with this?
- I feel like skills is very subjective. One might think they can play certain chord but might sound really bad. Given it's self-report app, how would you standardize or control quality of data?
- How do you find the instrumental / music score to know how to play a specific song?
- How do you measure mastery of a certain chord to suggest moving on? 
- It seems like the app is marketed as a tool for learning guitar generally (somewhat like a full curriculum), but only has support for keeping track of and learning chords. Is there support for learning different techniques/skills, or just chords? (for example, on violin there's skills like vibrato, bowing techniques, pizz vs arco, and etc beyond just the chords)
- Would it be hard/too much work for users to add all the chords they know, if they know a LOT? 
- How would this app account for user preferences in genre in terms of song recommendations?

#### Social
- Are you moderating the feed? How are you preventing negative comments on a user's post?
- How do you deal with the issue of creeps using this to find people nearby ? is there a setting to disallow proximity
- For the jam session, do users see the list of friends that play similar, same songs based on the chords and then manually choose which of those are close to meet in person?
- How would the jamming session work in terms of syncing in the sounds?

### Ideas
- Have you guys thought of transposing difficult songs to make them more accessible?
- Will ChordConnect be able to expand to other instruments besides the guitar?
- I feel like a lot of the functionality in the pitch is not exclusive to guitar learning. Is there any interest in expanding to other musical instruments?  
- In jam sessions, how can users of different levels be given songs? (would it be possible for different levels to receive the same song but easy / medium / hard versions? or different roles of the same song)
- Is there a way for users to suggest their own reharmonizations to familiar tunes?
