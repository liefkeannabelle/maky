### What are some aspects of the project that you like, and why?

I think your problem framing is very on point. There's definetly a need for tooling around storing and having different version of recipes. Especially with so many websites and apps offering recipes, it makes sense that many users would be lost. From personal experience, I had to create a google docs where I kept track of recipes from all places, but I never even thought to record their iterations (and doing it would make it very hard to navigate). 
Your app design seems very focused and the users have a real benefit from it. I liked the arguments behind your visual design study, especially the font decisions. I think a retro red could add a nice contrast with the cream-ish main color.

### What are some aspects of the project that you wish were different in some way?

Since one of the big issues you pointed out is how recipes live across random places on people’s phones, I think the whole flow of getting a recipe into the app is super important. Even supporting one website or having a clean strucutre when inputting a recipe could make the system feel more aligned with that problem.
Also, this is a random thought about ingredient scaling. Since your framing talks about learning from variations and adjusting dishes, having more flexible scaling than the usual 0.5x, 1x, 2x could support that too. Like sometimes you might have 2/5 eggs or 1 cup of milk from 3 and it's hard to scale down all the other ingredient amounts if the factor is not that pretty. And incorrect mental calculations could lead to iterations failing (even though the problem was different ratio, not other modifications the user wanted to make in an iteration)

### What are some aspects you are wondering about; perhaps some suggestions for a simplification, a different approach, or whatever?

I could see a natural addition/extension for social features  in the app, if you would be interested in that. 
At the lowest level of complexity, you could allow for a recipe import/export file (kind of like google calendars do it). 
That way, outside of your app, users could send each other recipe links/or files and be able to add them to their own "recipe book". The recipe doesn't *have* to have the tree of iterations, but it also could. 
I know I would definetly use this kind of feature, as me and my mom always talk about modifications on traditional cuisine recipes and this would be a very standard and easy way to share info. 
You could also go one step further and support a simplified version of chat (aka just allow users to share recipes in the app instead of having users export, send, and import).
