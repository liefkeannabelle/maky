# Final Report
## Design summary
A succinct but thoughtful summary of the changes you made to your design since the original proposal in your functional design submission. Your mentoring meeting notes should help in reminding you of all the changes you made.

** Making one note here that is not in the mentor meetings:  simplifying jam session mechanics 

## Reflection
A reflection on your experiences in the final project, focusing on what you learned from the experience, divided into a subsection for each team member.

I really enjoyed the team project, it was more interesting and easier to develop when there were multiple people working on the project. 
I think a big part of this team project was getting enough time to expand on non-conceptual design features as well (diagrams, socializing features, UI). I could see how these elements elevated our app, and worked to minimize friction, and maximize users' satisfaction, precisely the things we talked about in the class. 
Having the foundation of the individual proejct helped streamline all the design procedures we had before, as well as being accustomed with the technology (I had a very hard time with context in my first stages of the individual projects). Overall it was lots of fun, I'm really proud of the final product!
