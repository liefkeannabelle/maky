I really like the feature that matches known chords to suggested songs to learn. As someone who is currently learning guitar, I think this feature would actually be really useful for finding new repertoire that matches your skill level. 

Another feature I like is being able to keep track of songs you've learned. I think this is a really good way to help users build momentum and stay motivated by being able to see a log of the progress they've made. I'm not sure that the chord suggestion feature should be AI augmented, since I think there's a lot of room for an LLM to hallucinate nonexistent chords and incorrect fingerings. If there's no way to check the validity of the LLM suggestion, I think that could be pretty annoying. If it wasn't in your plan already, I think it would be good to include fingerings for each chord (multiple fingerings per chord) so that users have more guidance for each new chord. 

I'm also not sure that the jam session feature is necessary -- since presumably everyone on this app would be a guitar player, getting a bunch of guitarists together doesn't really make for the best band. 
 
Additionally, I think that some users might be too shy to share their progress videos, but I think it still makes sense to allow them to record and upload progress videos just for their own recordkeeping. Does your app currently support that, or do they have to share it to upload it?

I'm concerned about how the app data will be populated. Must users upload their own chords and songs? Where will you get data about songs and their chords? Where will you get data about fingerings?

I think ChordConnect is a really cool idea! When learning an instrument there’s such a broad range of music out there and when you’re self taught, it can be really difficult to find the intersection between what you can play and what you’re interested in, so I think the recommendation bot will be a really useful tool to learners. In a similar vein, I think the jams feature will help with making the most fun part of playing, making music with friends, a lot easier.	

I have reservations about how open the social media aspect is, specifically with respect to commenting on posts. I understand how publicly showing your progress and receiving encouragement and feedback is good for learning, but without a way to moderate comments, harassment or even just an excessive amount of criticism can be discouraging and drive away users from the app or even the guitar overall.

It may just be a misunderstanding on my part, but I’m a little confused as to whether the songs’ sheet music will actually be hosted on the app, or just be recommended and the user will have to go out and find the sheet music themselves. I feel like if it’s not hosted, then there isn’t as much of a draw for users, since the app is essentially a log for chords and songs and all of the actual learning will be done elsewhere. How will recommending songs based on known chords work? Any song can be pitched to a different key and thus use all different chords. Maybe suggest based on how the chords you know relate to each other?

Will aspects other than learned chords be taken into consideration when suggesting songs? Even if a song has chords you know, there are other things that can make it too difficult for a beginner like having tricky rhythm or a sequence of chords that are difficult to transition between in time. Maybe users can rate songs on how difficult they are and that can also be taken into account in recommendations.
