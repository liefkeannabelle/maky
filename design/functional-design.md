# Functional Design
## Problem framing
A revision of your problem framing to reflect your latest understanding

## Concept design
A collection of concept specifications and syncs; include a note section in each concept and sync to explain any non-obvious design decisions or to mark issues to be resolved.

## User journey
A narrative that follows a single stakeholder as they encounter the problem and use your designed app to address it.

## UI sketches
Low-fidelity sketches of your user interface that show the primary user interface elements and their rough layout, annotated with pointers or comments to explain anything that might not be obvious.

## Visual design study
Two slides (which can be inserted into markdown as images) that establish the “look and feel” of your app by assembling a range of sources and annotating them to establish a visual style with typographic, color and layout.

## Design summary
A summary of the overall design: how the concepts work together to solve the problem; how the design addresses any concerns that your ethics analysis raised; which issues remain unclear.

## Development plan
A table showing which features you expect to deliver at various stages, including at least the two checkpoints; an assignment of responsibilities to team members; a discussion of the key risks you face and how you will mitigate them (and your fallback option will be if something turns out to be unimplementable).
