#  AddCommentRequest` registers the author as "null", even thought the auther is the one from the session id, who called addcommentforuser. wehat is the issue (say briefly), then change so that the author is correctly recorded. output only the edited syncs and functions. i added some other syncs here so you can see how they are formatted. only output the EDITED FUNCTIONS. I don't need the unchanged code.
