# implement: a few tests covering all Following  actions. Reaction.test.ts shows you the structure of the tests, but refers to a different specs. DO NOT INCLUDE Reaction IN YOUR TESTS. WE ARE ONLY TESTING THE Following. Refer to Following.md for our spec, as well as the implementation in FollowingConcept.ts . Include   sanitizeOps: false,   sanitizeResources: false, in each of the deno tests, to prevent leaks. Don t do it with t.step stuff. the current code  in Following.test.md is weird and leads to compile errors. follow the imports from reaction.test.ts, to see how things are imported.

# response:

An implementation of tests for the `FollowingConcept` based on your specifications.
