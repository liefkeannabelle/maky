# implement: make a _getCommentsForPostId (post) which outputs [{text, user}[]]. I need it in this way because getters need to be non-empty arrays, otherwise it wouldn't fire. then, make a concept spec for it. then, also make an api spec for it. and finally, make a minimal deno test for it. minimal code as possible! also, only output the parts you added or modified. I dont need unchanged existing code pasted here. 

# response:
