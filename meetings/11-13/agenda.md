## Meeting Notes
Feedback on potential sourcing of song data:
- Like idea of AI-augmented feature, but very ambitious in the structure of the class
    - Yahir is familiar with some tools that would lend to it
    - Serves as more of a backup plan
- Just need enough songs to robustly show the fundamental functionality of the app
    - Course staff threw out 50-100 songs as a reasonable number (not a hard requirement)
    - Don't want to get caught up in the nitty-gritty of getting the songs in there

Questions from us:
- Recommendations for project pitch video
    - How much of the solution do we show? Since app is focused, we can describe the whole solution
    - Prioritizing features: write the user journey and determine if anything feels awkward in the flow
    - Is our scope good? Perfect level of specificity -- want projects with targeted problems and suit our interests
- Creating the development plan
    - What is the development plan? Full plan, revise after alpha deadline
    - What to implement in alpha vs beta? Start with most risk-prone features that are very fundamental (in our case: webscrabing for music)
        - Suggestion: draw a dependency draft between features/concepts and start at the root
        - Our thoughts: start with music scraping + chord recommendations
    - Advice for breaking up responsibility between us: break up by concept for modularity, assign according to ability to collaborate easily; for syncs, rely heavily on schedules lining up
