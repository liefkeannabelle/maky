## Meeting Notes
- Unsure about the Mongo DB clearing
- May want the ability to completely hide social components if users want to exclusively use it for learning 
  - Could try to uncover why the social component was offputting for some of our peers
  - Consider if those concerns would be prevalent among the target user
  - Should differentiate the beginner user experience vs the more acclimated user
