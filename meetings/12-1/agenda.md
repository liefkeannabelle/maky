# 12-1 Meeting 
## Agenda
- Review [progress report](progress-report.md) (10 minutes)
- Final plan for beta (10 minutes)

## Meeting Notes
- Still unsure what could be causing the database problem
  - Tiana helped us go through backend repo and couldn't find a root cause
- Reframing the "bio"
  - Since not visible to others, can be more of a note to self/goal setting
  - Change the name in the backend and make desired UI tweaks
- Want to have a pre-populated account for TAs to be able to test without having to start from step 1
- Current interface is sufficient for users setting their accounts up -> don't need to add the questionnaire
- Reasonable to scrap the following component -- either could be scrapped but shouldn't keep both
