Plans & decisions: plans for next week and decisions made

## Status Update
The last week was focused on creating the first two deliverables for the project: (1) the team contract and (2) the problem framing document.

1. The team contract was completed Friday afternoon during a group meeting. We were able to discuss each of the components and come to an agreement about how to distribute responsiblity, make decisions, and meet deadlines effectively. From this, we set up a shared Google Drive folder with the contract, plannig documents, and a project timeline tracker.

2. The [problem framing document](/design/problem-framing.md) was created in two phases.

    i. We established that our general area of interest was music or entertainment. Over the weekend, we each individually brainstormed potential problems in this domain and documented our thoughts within a shared brainstorming doc.

    ii. On Tuesday evening, we met to discuss each of our ideas and decide what problem we wanted to pursue. After talking through the potential strengths and weaknesses of each idea, we settled on our chosen problem. With this decided, we talked through each of the sections of the problem framing process, occasionally breaking out to think through thins individually then regrouping to discuss. By the end of the meeting, we had a solid draft of the problem framing document which we then cleaned up for submission.

## Design Changes
Obviously, our idea is quite fresh, so it has not changed since our submission of the problem framing document. We look forward to receiving feedback and are open to making changes as we work through each step of the design and development process.

## Issues
Currently, the concern raised by TAs over email is the main issue that we are working to address:
- Accessibilty of song data - We are looking into potential sources of song data and will work to evaluate the feasibility of our overall design given what we find.

## Plans & Decisions
With the problem framing done, our focus falls on preparing the two upcoming deliverables: (1) [project pitch](/design/project-pitch-plan.md) and (2) [functional design doc](/design/functional-design.md). 

### 1. Project Pitch
This consists of few main to-dos:
1. Identify key points to cover within the video
2. Determine best format
3. Create a script + assign roles
4. Schedule a time for filming
5. Film video
6. Edit to prepare for submission 
In this meeting, we will tackle tasks 1-4.

### 2. Functional Design Document
This consists of the following main to-dos:
1. Revisit and refine problem framing
2. Brainstorm and finalize key concepts + syncs
3. Create user journey
4. Create UI sketches
5. Explore visual design style and create visual design study
6. Write design summary
7. Create development plan
In this meeting, we will discuss each of these at a high-level and assign responsibilities to team members to begin work on each component.
